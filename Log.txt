Final Lab: Austin Strobel and Anika Roskowski
Battleship Game

The first 4 hours of this project where spent trying to figure out how to use github and how to compile c++ on our computers. 
Austin still cannot compile c++ on his computer.
After much trial and tribulation we were able to get it working by creating a live collaboration from Anika's computer through SSH. 
  This means that all work had to be done collaboratively, at the same time. 

We also can work separately with Anika using VS Code and Austin using the Hydra machines. We both SSH into our Github repo to push and pull. 

Tasks:
  Ship.h
  Board.h
  ClassFunctions.cpp
  Battleship.cpp
  User Interface - Austin
  placeShips() - Anika

Ship.h, Board.h, Board.cpp, and Ship.cpp - 3 hours each
  ClassFunctions.cpp hold both sets of functions --> ClassFunctions.cpp got split into Ship.cpp and Board.cpp
  12/4 still need to polish up Board::placeShip
  
Battleship.cpp - 1 hour
  12/4 Have most things templated but needs a lot of work.
