Final Lab: Austin Strobel and Anika Roskowski
Battleship Game

The first 4 hours of this project where spent trying to figure out how to use github and how to compile c++ on our computers. 
Austin still cannot compile c++ on his computer.
After much trial and tribulation we were able to get it working by creating a live collaboration from Anika's computer through SSH. 
  This means that all work had to be done collaboratively, at the same time. 
  
Tasks:
  Ship.h
  Board.h
  ClassFunctions.cpp
  Battleship.cpp

Ship.h, Board.h, and ClassFunctions.cpp - 3 hours each
  ClassFunctions.cpp hold both sets of functions.
  12/4 still need to polish up Board::placeShip
  
Battleship.cpp - 1 hour
  12/4 Have most things templated but needs a lot of work.
